# Hi, I'm Nori :)

I’m a Frontend Developer and aspiring UI/UX Designer with a passion for crafting beautiful, user-friendly interfaces. I love blending design and code to create seamless digital experiences. Inspired by brutalist architecture, design, and long city walks, I bring my curiosity for small details into the way I build and create.

🚀 I’m currently looking for my first frontend developer role — excited to join a team where I can learn, build, and contribute. Open to international opportunities.



## 🛠 My Tech Toolbox  
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** React, Tailwind CSS 
- **Currently Learning:** Three.js
